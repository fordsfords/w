</p><p>First I had to get the fine folks at <a href="http://suso.org" class="external free" title="http://suso.org" rel="nofollow">http://suso.org</a> to set me up.  This took a while, mainly because I told them that it was very low priority and really guys, don't go out of your way or anything if it's a PITA.  And it was a bit of a PITA for them so I just kept checking in every three months or so until Jan '08.  Then I had some real reasons for wanting the wiki and asked that they bump the priority.  About 2 days later, it was up and running.  I like suso.
</p><p>At any rate, they told me to run <a href="http://wiki.geeky-boy.com/w/config/index.php" class="external free" title="http://wiki.geeky-boy.com/w/config/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.geeky-boy.com/w/config/index.php</a> and configure the wiki.  Here's how I filled it out (most of them were defaulted):
</p>

</pre>
<p>Then, as per instructions, I moved the config/LocalSettings.php file up a directory, set it's file mode (permissions) to 660, and moved the config directory to ~/wiki_config.  Then uploaded the whirlpool galaxy pic to skins/common/images/GeekyInfo.jpg.
</p><p>Then, based in part on the instructions I found at <a href="http://23rdworld.com/2007/03/30/how-to-make-your-mediawiki-private/" class="external free" title="http://23rdworld.com/2007/03/30/how-to-make-your-mediawiki-private/" rel="nofollow">http://23rdworld.com/2007/03/30/how-to-make-your-mediawiki-private/</a> I added the following lines to the LocalSettings.php file:
</p>
<pre> $wgLogo = "skins/common/images/GeekyInfo.jpg";
 # This snippet prevents new registrations from anonymous users
 # (Sysops can still create user accounts)
 $wgGroupPermissions['*']['createaccount'] = false;
 # $wgGroupPermissions['*']['read'] = false;
 $wgGroupPermissions['*']['edit'] = false;
 $wgWhitelistRead = array( "Main Page", "Special:Userlogin", "-", "MediaWiki:Monobook.css" );
</pre>
<p>This lets the world read the wiki, but requires an account to edit it.  It also disables account creation by anybody except for admins.
</p><p>Then I created the <a href="MediaWiki:Nosuchuser.html" title="MediaWiki:Nosuchuser">MediaWiki:Nosuchuser</a> page.  (Note that the content of that page is *not* normally displayed as a wiki page, but instead as an error message.  As a result, wikitext isn't interpreted.
</p><p>Then I created accounts "SfordSysop" and "Sford", gave the former admin privileges, and created user and talk pages for them.  Then I created the user and talk pages for them and created the Main Page.  Then, I protected the main page, the privileged user pages, and a small admin tips page I created.
</p><p>I think that's about it.  Oh, somewhere in there I created the <a href="Geekyinfo:About.html" title="Geekyinfo:About">Geekyinfo:About</a> page and set a few watch pages here and there.
