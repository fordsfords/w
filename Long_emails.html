			<p><b>ACTION</b>
</p><p>I want people to <b>change how they write long emails</b>.
</p><p>There are good reasons to sometimes write long emails.  However, I have seen too many that are <b>ineffective</b>.  No action is taken until you bring the subject up later, and then it's almost as if the recipients never read it.  And for good reason - they only got two or three paragraphs in and stopped reading.  They never saw your conclusions, or your requested actions.
</p><p>You and your recipients will be happier if you follow the guidelines herein.
</p><p><br />
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
</p><p>The basic idea is simple - write your email such that whenever the reader stops reading, they have read the most important part for them to read.  If they only read 10%, make sure it's the 10% you really want them to see.
</p><p>Order of content:
</p>
<ol><li> ACTION - The first lines should be a short summary of the actions you want people to take.  Not much detail - save detail for the "gory details" section.<br /><br />
</li><li> CONCLUSION - Now state your conclusions ... <i>without</i> supporting arguments.<br /><br />
</li><li> GORY DETAILS - This is where you build the case with all your data and logic.<br /><br />
</li></ol>
<p>Ideally, you've been succinct enough in 1 and 2 that even the most busy executive had time to get through them.
</p><p><br />
<b>GORY DETAILS</b>
</p><p>You see, the problem is that the most-important readers - the people with the authority to make things happen - they tend to be overworked.  Everybody depends on them, so they have very little time.  That's why it is unrealistic to expect them to read all the way through a long email to find the conclusion and action items.  More often than not, they stop reading after the first screen.  Given that you probably spent 2 hours or more writing it, an unread email is actually <i>worse</i> than no email at all.
</p><p>Most people write by building a case.  They lead the reader through a set of logical arguments, followed by their conclusion.  Finally, they request action.  This kind of email needs to be turned upside down.  I sometimes tell people to write the email normally, then cut the last paragraph and paste it at the top.  That alone probably gets you half-way there.
</p><p>A few other suggestions:
</p>
<ul><li> Start the Gory Details section with a statement of the problem.  A brief version of it often needs to be added near the top to put the actions and conclusions in context.
</li><li> For urgent or important issues, I suggest prefixing the subject with the words "URGENT:" or "Important:".
</li><li> Use all-caps bolded lines as section headers.  A long email of paragraph after paragraph is intimidating.  Organizing it into sections helps break up the monotony.  Also, if the reader already knows about a section, it's much easier to skip it and read the next.
</li></ul>
<p>Note that I started the "Gory Details" section of this page with a more-detailed statement of the problem.  You frequently have to also state the problem near the top; the actions and conclusions may make no sense without the context of the problem you're trying to solve.  Just be careful - it's easy to drift into providing supporting evidence too early.  You want the early problem statement to be short - just enough so that the actions and conclusions have context.  Save the detail and support for the gory details.
</p><p>It can feel awkward to invert the order like this.  Once I get into the gory details, I give myself more freedom to write the way I want to write.  After all, the only people reading that part are the people who are *interested* in the gory details.  So I'm less likely to lose the audience in the middle.  (And even if I do, at least I got the really important stuff out of the way right up at the top.)
</p><p>In case you haven't noticed, I've structured this article in the same way I try to write long emails.  (And yes, I sometimes forget to follow my own rules.)
</p><p><br />
<b>SPECIAL CASE: BUG REPORTS</b>
</p><p>Bug reports, though technically not emails, should also be written this way.  Many bug reports start out with instructions on how to reproduce the problem, followed by a description and discussion of the problem itself.
</p><p>I would like bug reports to structured roughly as above, so that a busy manager can get the gist of it after reading half a screen.  Please include conclusions, opinions and judgement calls early.  That allows management to more-accurately prioritize and assign them.
