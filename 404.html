<center><h1>404</h1></center>

<p>I've moved my web hosting, and I've had to remove some content.

<p>In particualr, I've had to shut down BBST.  Sorry.

<p>I've also shut down my wiki, but I've dumped its contents
<a href="http://www.geeky-boy.com/w/">here</a>.

<p>You can always go to my <a href="http://www.geeky-boy.com">home page</a>, find my
email address (yes, it is there), and contact me.
