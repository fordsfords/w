</p><p>Astronomy is a hobby of mine.  My old site has a bunch of <a href="http://www.geeky-boy.com/astro/" class="external text" title="http://www.geeky-boy.com/astro/" rel="nofollow">astronomy stuff</a> including <a href="http://www.geeky-boy.com/astro/kid_scope.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geeky-boy.com/astro/kid_scope.html" rel="nofollow">Parent's Guide to Children's Telescopes</a>.  The info in there is dated since I haven't kept it up, but the principles are the same.
</p><p>Anyway, I don't know if I'll ever move any of that content to this wiki, but I did want to document a story I find inspiring.  The Genesis spacecraft.

<p>When I was a kid, I remember following various spacecraft news stories, about how things went wrong and scientists and engineers on the ground had to think up very creative ways to fix them since they couldn't just pop over with a tool kit and hit it with a hammer.  I was equally amazed at their ingenuity of the repairs and the flexibility of the original design to make it fixable.  I wanted to do that.
