</p><p>In lesson one, you learned four commands:
</p>
<ul><li> <b>list</b> - show your program
</li><li> <b>run</b> - try to run your program
</li><li> <b>10</b> - typing a line number by itself removes a line from your program
</li><li> <b>10 hello</b> - typing a line number followed by other stuff adds a line to your program 
</li></ul>
<p>Here is another command.  Type this:
</p>
<pre>print "hello world!"
print 4 + 99
print "three times seven is"; 3 * 7
</pre>
<p>Note the semi-colon used on the last <b>print</b> line.  It separates two <em>things</em> that you want printed.  The first thing is the <em>string</em> "three times seven is".  And the second is the arithmetic calculation <b>3 * 7</b>.  A string must be inside double-quote marks, and is just some text that the computer doesn't try to understand.  If you type some stuff to be printed and it is NOT enclosed in double-quotes, then the computer will try to interpret it as either a number or a calculation.  Also note that the output of the "print" command smooshed together the string and the calculation.  The semi-colon tells the computer to smoosh them.  Try it again with:
</p>
<pre>print "three times seven is "; 3 * 7
</pre>
<p>See the space before the end quote?  That makes the output nicer.
</p><p>One more:
</p>
<pre>print "Never eat "; 27 / 9; " pizzas"
</pre>
<p>Back in the old days, you used a computer with a device that printed the computers output on paper instead of showing it on the screen.  So the command "print" made sense.  Now it just means "display".
</p><p>Now do this:
</p>
<pre>new
list
</pre>
<p>The <b>new</b> tells the computer that you want to start a new program.  It erases whatever program is currently in Basic.
</p><p>Now type:
</p>
<pre>10 print "hello world!"
list
</pre>
<p>Notice that when you typed <tt>10&nbsp;print&nbsp;"hello&nbsp;world!"</tt> it did not actually <b>do</b> the command.  It just remembered it as a line of program.
</p><p>Now type:
</p>
<pre>run
</pre>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS!  You have just written your first successful program!  But the two hours is not up yet!  There is more to do.
