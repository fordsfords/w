			<p>It’s eleven o’clock and I’ve already sent three salesmen packing.  One of them wouldn’t take “no” for an answer - he ended up face-down on the sidewalk.  And now I’ve got some poor sap begging me for my help.  If I didn’t need the money, he would be kissing the sidewalk with the other chumps.  But I got bills, and he’s got dough.  I guess I gotta make nice.
</p><p>I’m Charlene Clausen.  I’m a private eye.
</p><p>“You’ve gotta help me!  I’ve got nowhere else to turn!  These fliers have GOT to make it to the show!”  Mr. M’s eyes were red and his face was white.  Double-barrel Rudolf during a snow storm.
</p><p>I took pity on him.  “Turn off the water works, Mr. M, I’ll give the thumb screws an extra turn and get ‘em for you on time.”
</p><p>I only wish I could take the relief off his face, bottle it and sell it.  I could retire to Tahiti.
</p><p>Time to see a man about a dog.  I hit the grimy streets of Warrenville with a burn of rubber.  I-88, 294, Highway 22, my hopped-up iron ate up the miles almost as fast as it ate up the gas.  And before you could say dead-beat geek, I was pounding on a non-descript door in a neighborhood with plenty of script.  You can’t talk to the maids on this street without an appointment.
</p><p>The door opened and I stood facing a geezer in a bathrobe, pointing the business end of an iPhone at my chest.  Now I’ve seen things that would send a cop home early, but you do NOT want to know what an iPhone can do to you.  It ain’t pretty.
</p><p>I flicked my eyes to the glowing screen, then back to the geezer’s face.  “Wikipedia, eh?  Is that what you people call ‘working from home’ these days?”
</p><p>“What the heck do you want?” he demanded, beads of sweat forming on his forhead.
</p><p>“Hey, hey ... we’re friends, you and me.  We go way back.  I just wanna talk.”  I would rather be talking to my main squeeze right now, but Geezer-boy will have to do.  I gave him my most fetching smile.
</p><p>“So talk!”  He didn't invite me in.
</p><p>“Hey, it’s about that flier you said would be ready this morning?  I just wanted to know how it’s going, that’s all.”  I was really pouring on the old charm.  And it looked like I still had it.  The iPhone started to waver.
</p><p>“You’ll get your flier.  I’ve been busy.”
</p><p>His eyes flicked here and there, no longer really looking at me.  I could see he needed his next fix, needed to feel the cool plastic under his fingers, needed to see the liquid-crystal glow.  Well I needed some liquid myself, but mine comes out of a bottle, not a flat screen.  I stood there, knowing what would happen.  Sure enough, his head jerked to the side - just a quick glance over his shoulder to make sure his precious computer was still there.  I simply reached out, grabbed his wrist, and gave it a twist.  The iPhone clattered to the ground and Geezer-boy started dancing like his feet were on fire.  I caught a glimpse inside his robe ... tighty whiteys.  More than I ever wanted to know.
</p><p>“EEEK!  UNCLE!  I GIVE!  OW!  DON’T STEP ON THE PHONE!”
</p><p>I yanked his arm down, put my mouth to his ear and hissed, “You haven’t even started, have you?”
</p><p>“I’LL START RIGHT NOW!  YOU’LL HAVE IT FIRST THING TOMORROW!”
</p><p>Good thing I left a little slack in the schedule.  I gave the iPhone a little kick.  As it skiddered across the floor, I put as much menace as I could muster into my voice.  “See that you do.”
</p><p>I dropped his arm and beat it for my ride.  Never could stand to see a grown man cry.  But at least Mr. M would get his fliers on time, meaning that my bank account would get a nice infusion on time.  As I pulled back into HQ's parking lot, I knew it was just another cold winter day on the mean streets of Warrenville.
