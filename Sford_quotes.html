</p>
<ul><li> Me: (IM) in response to a friend promising to use an annoying phrase with me from now on: "Good!  A lesser man would know when the joke got old."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Me: (email) about proposing a design as a starting point: "... so that we aren't starting from a <i>tabula rasa</i> (Polish for 'pointless thrashing')."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Me: (spoken) about a customer who wasn't going to get his way, "That's a bowl of cereal they'll just have to learn to eat."
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Me: (spoken) about the lack of formal documentation: "In a pinch, we can just give them some wiki-scrape."
</li></ul>
